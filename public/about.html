<p><h4>
Prophetess Shelsy Royal is a chosen and set-apart servant of God, faithfully walking in her prophetic calling for over six years across Hyderabad, Kurnool, and Chennai. While just working as a Software Engineer at Oracle, Trivandrum, her life remains fully surrendered to the call of God. She carries a burden to raise lives in truth and obedience, serving as the Mentor of The Chosen Fellowship and the Founder of Living the Christ Way, leading believers into holiness, intimacy with Christ, and a life that reflects Jesus. Praise God so for such a powerful and anointed Daughter of God
